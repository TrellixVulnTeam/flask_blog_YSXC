This is an excellent tutorial, but I had some trouble. First, I created a folder called "Py-proj01" to put my project in. Using the Windows Command Prompt (run as Administrator) on Windows 10, I made a few adjustments to get the "Hello World" in my Chrome browser. The commands I entered follow the ">"

C:\WINDOWS\system32>cd C:\Py-proj01

C:\WINDOWS\system32>py -m virtualenv flask

C:\Py-proj01>flask\Scripts\activate

(flask) C:\Py-proj01>pip install flask

(flask) C:\Py-proj01>set FLASK_APP=flaskblog.py

(flask) C:\Py-proj01>flask run
